# RMI

This project is an assignment made to help us understand better the fundamental concepts of RMI in Java

RMI or Remote Object Invocation, allows us to call methods from distant objects as if they were local.

In this repository, you'll find 2 folders, one for the server, and one for the client which will attempt to call methods from that server.
